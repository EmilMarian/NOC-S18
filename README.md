# The Nature of Code, Spring 2018

Can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software? Can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world world help us to create digital worlds? This class focuses on the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems. We explore topics ranging from basic mathematics and physics concepts to more advanced simulations of complex systems. Subjects covered include physics simulation, trigonometry, self-organization, genetic algorithms, and neural networks. Examples are demonstrated in JavaScript using [p5.js](http://p5js.org). Much of the class time will be dedicated to in-class exercises and self-study as much of the course is [available online through a video series](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?shelf_id=6&view_as=subscriber&sort=dd&view=50) and [textbook](http://natureofcode.com/book/).
